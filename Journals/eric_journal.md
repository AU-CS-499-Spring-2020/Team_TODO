# Journal for Eric Jordan
## 1/30/2020
Met with Aaron to set up my dev environmnent. Ran into some issues, but will meet tomorrow to deal with them.

## 1/31/2020
Met with Aaron again, finished setting up dev environment. Learned the basics of git and pushed my first commit. 

## 2/4/2020
Met with Aaron, discussed styling, but were cut short since Aaron felt sick.

## 2/11/2020
Met with Aaron, finished working on base template. We decided to let me attempt to create the login page by myself, so I will have more experience working with html and css. Began learning about html and css tonight, and started making some attempts at designing a login page.

## 2/12/2020
Kept working with login page. Once I started feeling more comfortable with html and css, I began some work on the signup page as well.

## 2/13/2020
Met with Aaron, we looked at my login page and sign up page and made some better design decisions.

## 2/22/2020
Continued cleaning up both the login and sign up pages, added features such as "Don't have an account?" that takes the user from the login page to the sign up page.

## 2/29/2020
Got login and sign up pages to a point that I feel comfortable presenting them. Brought to the attention of Aaron that we did not have a functioning "Forgot Password" system. Decided I would do some research on what all went into that system after the presentation.

## 3/11/2020 
Began doing some research on "Forgot Password", the process is looking pretty difficult considering we would need to be able to either send an email or text to the user, which is a whole setup in the backend. Will bring it up the next time the team meets to see what we should do. 

## 3/31/2020
Met with the team. Decided we would not be worrying about the "Forgot Password" system as it is too intensive and out of the span of our project. I also offered to create the "Create Ticket" page. Will begin work in the coming days. 

## 4/4/2020
Got a good start on the "Create Ticket" page. Was unsure what to really do with it style wise, but all of the inputs are there so it is functional.

## 4/5/2020
Did some final touches on the "Create Ticket" page so that it will be presentable. Also had a practice Zoom meeting with the team so we knew what to expect during the presentations. 

## 4/11/2020
Worked on styling for error messages throughout all of Pycket. Cleaned up a few other styling things before URCA.

## 4/14/2020
Met with the team to practice for URCA. Also discussed what we would begin working on after URCA. I decided I would work on the "Edit Ticket" page, which should be very similar to the "Create Ticket" page.
