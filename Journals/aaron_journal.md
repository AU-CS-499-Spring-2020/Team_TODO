Updated signup/login pages and added client-side password verification. Changed to a login page as opposed to a login modal. A login page works better and is easier to integrate/maintain

## 2/17/2020
Creating base template and extended templates for ticket section of software such as create/edit ticket.

## 2/18/2020
Worked on ticket section, started base template and began extension for other templates mentioned above. I am stuck on an error with 'ticket.index' not being recognized as a URL endpoint, but I am able to access it as a method. I am unsure why it is not being recognized as an endpoint.

## 2/20/2020
Worked on ticket section, attempting to route between landing page and our main ticketing page, unable to correctly route and receiving an error 'unable to builtd url endpoint for 'ticket.index'. This error makes it seem as though index is not defined within the ticket blueprint, but it is? Unsure of where this error is coming from.

Edit: I'm stupid.
